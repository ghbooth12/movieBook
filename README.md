## Moviebook

Moviebook is an online social media application where users can share their reviews on movies and search the movie review. It is a single-page application built in AngularJS so this app doesn’t require page loads when navigating between pages as most web sites do. This basically makes the app’s reaction time much faster.

### How it works

##### Post movie review
You can search for movies in the search box. It will show you movie posters and genres automatically. Rate it with stars and write your review of the movie.

##### Quick movie search
Enter the movie name you want in the search box. It quickly finds movies you want. You don't need to type the whole movie title. Just type it partially, it will find the movie you're looking for.
