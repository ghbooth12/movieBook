## Moviebook

Moviebook is an online social media where users can share their reviews on movies and search the movie review. It is a single-page application built in AngularJS so this app doesn’t require page loads when navigating between pages as most web sites do. This basically makes app’s reaction much faster.

### How it works

##### Post movie review
You can search movies in the search box. It will show you movie posters and its genres automatically. Rate it with stars and write your view on the movie.

##### Quick movie search
Enter the movie name you want in the search box. It finds movies you want quickly. You don't need to type the whole movie title. Just type it partially, it will find the movie you're looking for.
